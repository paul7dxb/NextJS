## Security

- Many of the packages / libraries used in these example applications are or will become outdated as time goes by. This can lead to vulnerable applications if deployed.
- It is recommended to update and use the latest versions to minimise the security risk.
- Outdated components were number 6 on the [OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)
